By JONATHAN HILL and ADAM LEE in Macau <COREF ID="5" REF="X2">Two Chinese crew members</COREF>
were killed Tuesday when their <COREF ID="X3">helicopter</COREF> crashed near <COREF ID="8" REF="2">Macau</COREF>.


The China Southern Helicopter Company <COREF ID="9" REF="X3">aircraft</COREF> was on <COREF ID="10" REF="2">its</COREF> way to
 <COREF ID="X8">Zhuhai</COREF>, apparently returning from an oil rig, when <COREF ID="11" REF="10">it</COREF> crashed, said
a spokesman for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation <COREF ID="X6">Department</COREF>.


Other reports said <COREF ID="13" REF="X3">the helicopter</COREF>, which went down 10 to <COREF ID="X5">15</COREF>
nautical miles southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering
weather information.


<COREF ID="14" REF="40">The incident</COREF> fell within Hong Kong airspace, triggering a <COREF ID="X4">search</COREF>
by Civil Aviation Department rescuers.


Two Government Flying Service helicopters joined <COREF ID="16" REF="8">Macau</COREF> Marine
Police in <COREF ID="17" REF="X4">the search</COREF> for <COREF ID="18" REF="X5">the Sikorsky 76</COREF>.


<COREF ID="19" REF="2">Mainland</COREF> <COREF ID="X9">authorities</COREF> later told <COREF ID="20" REF="X6">the department</COREF>'s Aeronautical
Rescue Co-ordination Centre the wreckage had been recovered from
the Chinese <COREF ID="X7">island</COREF> of <COREF ID="21" REF="2">Daiwaishan</COREF>.


``Someone on <COREF ID="22" REF="X7">the island</COREF> heard a noise and called <COREF ID="23" REF="X8">Zhuhai</COREF> airport
authorities,'' said a <COREF ID="24" REF="8">Macau</COREF> aviation source. ``<COREF ID="25" REF="2">China</COREF> sent a
helicopter and confirmed <COREF ID="26" REF="40">the crash</COREF> on <COREF ID="27" REF="22">the island</COREF>.''


<COREF ID="28" REF="8">Macau</COREF> authorities, who lost radar contact at 10 am, said <COREF ID="29" REF="9">the pilots</COREF> had been found at the site ``and appeared dead''.


<COREF ID="30" REF="23">Zhuhai</COREF> officials confirmed <COREF ID="31" REF="29">the crew</COREF> had been killed.


Sources suggested that poor weather was <COREF ID="32" REF="40">the likely cause of the crash</COREF>.


The Royal Observatory reported strong winds in the area at <COREF ID="34" REF="11">the time</COREF>. Rescuers also reported poor visibility.


<COREF ID="35" REF="2">China</COREF>, as <COREF ID="36" REF="X9">the country of registration</COREF>, would investigate <COREF ID="37" REF="14">the incident</COREF>, the <COREF ID="38" REF="20">Civil Aviation Department</COREF> said.
